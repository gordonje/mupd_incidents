Scraping, parsing and re-publishing University of Missouri Police Department Incident Reports

## Intro

The University of Missour Police Department publishes data on its website about their cases. They're doing a great job keeping the data up-to-date, but there are a couple of problems:

1.	The [incident page](http://vco.missouri.edu/mupdcfs/) has filter options to find specific kinds of incidents within a date range and/or at a specific address, which is nice. But some of the less common charges, like making a terrorist threat, aren't categorized under an incident type. Furthermore, not all cases originate from an incident report, so you won't even find those cases on this list.

2.	The [daily clery reports](http://mupolice.missouri.edu/blotter/) include every case and more information about each one, including the exact charges and the current disposition of the case. But, the daily reports are [published as pdfs](http://mupolice.missouri.edu/blotter/November/111115.pdf), which prevents any searching or analysis.

We can do better. Here's how:
1.	Download the daily clery reports;
2.	Extract the text from the pdf pages;
3.	Parse that text into a database;
4.	Build a web app for users to interact with this improved data.
